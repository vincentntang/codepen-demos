Changelog of Amazon Canvas Snow Demo

### 1. Added snow-ish like gravity

- Based on video 3b+ of chris canvas courses
- Change the y position to start uptop.
- Modify dy to be more predictable

### 2. Added dx change for snow

- Looks janky, but I adjusted `dx` based on a counter value

### 3. Amazon snow working as expected

- Fixed the spawn so circles would start uptop instead
- Issues - some of the snow fades away over time, possibly because it goes off screen forever, but maybe that's a good thing
